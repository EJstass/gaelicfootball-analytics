# gaelicfootball-analytics

Gaelic Football is an Irish team sport. I have played Gaelic Football for the Hartford GAA since 2021. Analytics for sports has been gaining popularity, but I noticed there is little discussion about analytics techniques for Gaelic Football. The following project is my work to start the process of better understanding the game. The goal is provide insight on how to improve both individual and team performance. Up Hartford!
